**Testing CodeRabbit AI for getting help with PRs, maybe some better documentation with PRs?**

**Things seen so far:**
1. Pretty slow, even for small PRs. Added only like 30 Lines of code and it took 5 Minutes to process. Probably the Free Trial is limited, so hopefully not so slow with Pro Subscribtion. If not fast enough it is especially problematic when back to back checking ig the AI didnt haluciante some stuff, so you can reedit the main comment on it so you can specify more clearly what the pr is about. You dont want to wait for 5 Minutes, do something else and than go to the old PR and reedit the comment.
2. Pretty neat atleast on simple stuff: https://github.com/vankatadam/code-rabbit-ai-test/pull/1
3. Can generate PRs on its own like this one: https://github.com/vankatadam/code-rabbit-ai-test/pull/2
4. I got 3 App Notifications on the generated PR, which is a bit annoying

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
